### Get your mod list 101

To get your mod list in Windows if you don't use a modpack, open your minecraft *mods* folder and copy the path from the field on the top.
It will look something like this: `C:\the\path\to\the\file`.

Then open a command prompt and type:

> cd "PASTE_YOUR_PATH_HERE"

Followed by enter. Double quotes are necessary!

After that, without closing the prompt, type

>dir /b>mod_list.txt

Followed by enter.

This will create a file called "mod_list.txt" in your mods directory, containing the whole list of installed mods. Send it via pastebin

### Using PASTEBIN to post a file

1. Open the file with a notepad software (Windows notepad works ok, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/) is better)
2. Copy its content (Ctrl+A to select everything, Ctrl+C to copy)
3. Open [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com)
4. Paste what you copied and confirm with the "Create new Paste" button
5. Send me the link of the page you get redirected to, **not the whole content of the file**, please.
